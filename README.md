#README for FDR-regression repository

This folder contains the code to fully reproduce the simulations and data analysis in the paper
"A regression framework for the proportion of true null hypotheses" by SM Boca and JT Leek.

Before running the code, please make sure you install the packages swfdr and FDRreg, available at:
https://github.com/leekgroup/swfdr
https://github.com/jgscott/FDRreg

The directory structure is as follows:
##BMI GIANT GWAS meta-analysis
This directory contains the code to perform the data analysis and generate Figures 3 and 4.
The data must first be downloaded from https://www.broadinstitute.org/collaboration/giant/index.php/GIANT_consortium_data_files#GWAS_Anthropometric_2015_BMI
It is not included here, due to file size limitations.

The file 1.read_in_GIANT.Rmd reads in the data in tsv format and creates the BMI_GIANT_GWAS.RData file. Running it also generates the file 1.read_in_GIANT.pdf.





##simulations.Rnw

This file contains the code to generate Figures 1 and 2.

##diff_samp_size_variances.Rnw

This file contains the code to generate the results for Table 2.
